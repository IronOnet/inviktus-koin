## What is Inviktus-Koin 

Inviktus-Koin is an ERC-20 token backed 1 for 1 by USD dollars, this token will be 
used to trade other digital currency in an crypto-currency exchange, users will 
purchase the token in an OTC market where they will exchange cash for the equivalent in Inviktus and will then deposit the token in the exchange 
to trade it for other crypto currency and will also be able to redeem the equivalent in cash if so they wish, since it's currently almost impossible to interoperate with most bank payment systems in the D.R.C

## Wallet 

The inviktus token is an ERC-20 token, wich means that it is compatible with most 
ethereum wallets in the market.
